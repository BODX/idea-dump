# Idea dump

So, here it goes. Our list of world unfuckafication hacks, ideas and some products even - for everyone to gaze at, laugh at, copy but not steal (no copyrights).
Instead of falling for our own fallacy thinking _At some point I am gonna do this!_ it was truth time. How many of those can we realistically play with and then put into practice?
We would love to see others jump on these ideas, breath live into them. Get in touch if you want us to help you with one of those, or you like to collaborate.

Work side by side in Sketch and compare designs online, maybe have a shared page.
