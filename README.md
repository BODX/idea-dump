# idea-dump
Open list of ideas for world unfuckafication hacks and some products even

Instead of pretending we are the best thing after sliced bread has been patented away from everyone and left only for one rich guy to look at in awe, we decided to step away from our egos and accept the realization that our ideas are not so special, that we cannot realize them all (or enough to effectively shield them from others), and that the only to effectively contribute something in an ever-changing world is to make our work common and available for everyone.


Check the ideabook.md file or our website. There is the html version of this list. Also, the website is open-source and in another repo.
